## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla HTML and CSS
- Vite for build/live-reload

### What I learned

This was my first Frontend Mentor challenge, so it was good to get familiarized with the process and workflow. I used Vite for building, which was an easy drop-in with just a few lines of code. For hosting, I went with Netlify, which was also really easy to set up - simply point to the github repo and tell Netlify how to build, and where to look for the build output.

In addition, I used this opportunity to get familiar with self-hosting fonts, which was also a pretty simple process, but worth getting to know. 

### Continued development

Some of my font sizes are off when comparing my submission on the Frontend Mentor website. I think this was because I used two different monitors to look at the design and my work, so I ended up adjusting the sizes to some magic-numbery rem values. Next time I'll be sure to compare on the same monitor before submitting.
